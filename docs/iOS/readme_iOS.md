## Prerequisites


* The standard <a href="/readme.md#prerequisites">Prerequisites</a> for all platforms.
* The iOS unity <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/2020.1/Documentation/Manual/GettingStartedAddingEditorComponents.html">module</a>.
* Xcode 10.2.x.

<br />

## Importing the Plugin


You can follow the standard <a href="/readme.md#importing-the-plugin">Importing the Plugin</a> process. With a few changes here when <a href="/readme.md#samples">running the samples</a> and <a href="/readme.md#configuring-the-plugin">configuring the plugin</a>.
> :heavy_exclamation_mark: If you choose the tarball method, when downloading the release it may convert the ```.tgz``` into a ```.tar``` which is not compatible with unity. Changing the file extension back to a ```.tgz``` should fix this.

<br />

## Samples

You can follow the standard <a href="/readme.md#samples">Samples</a> process.  With the additional steps between ```3.``` and ```4.``` when running from a build.
> :heavy_exclamation_mark: The EOS Overlay is not implemented yet. But when it is due to the limitations of phones, the EOS Overlay is not set to be openable by a physical button.

<br />

## Running the samples

<b> Additional steps to run a sample from a build between ```3.``` and ```4.```.</b>

1. Open the ```.xcodeproj``` in xcode.

2. Follow the Apple Developer instructions to build and run the app <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/running-your-app-in-simulator-or-on-a-device">here</a>.
