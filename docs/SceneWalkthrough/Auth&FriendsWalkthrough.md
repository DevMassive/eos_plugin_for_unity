## **Auth & Friends Demo**
This demo showcases an implementation of the friends list into a game UI. The panel on the right shows the user's friend list and status of each friend.
- The ``Refresh`` button refreshes the list, repolling for information
- The ``Friends Overlay`` button opens the EOS overlay
