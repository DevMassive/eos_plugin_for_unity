## Supported Versions of Unity
Due to Unity's versioning there is a "current supported" version. Modestly newer or older versions may work without error, work with minor tweaks, or require a prohibitively large amount of work to function properly.

For that reason, this plugin specifically targets the following version of the Unity Editor: [Unity 2021.3.8.f1](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2021.3.8).

Versions of the Unity Editor that start with 2021 will _usually_ work without error, but other versions are not officially supported at this time.
