## Supported Versions of Unity
Due to Unity's versioning there is a "current supported" version, newer and older versions may work without error, work with minor tweaks needed, work with rewriting core parts, or may simply not work. 

The version the plugin works off of currrently is [```Unity 2021.3.8.f1```](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2021.3.8).

Other versions of Unity 2021 will usually work without error, however unity versions outside of 2021 are not officially supported.
